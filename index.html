            <p>I know we're just like old friends<br>
                We just can't pretend <br>
                That lovers make <br>
                We are reasons so unreal <br>
                We can't help but feel that something has been lost <br>
                But please you know you're just like me <br>
                Next time I promise we'll be <br>
                Perfect <br>
                Perfect <br>
                Perfect strangers down the line <br>
                Lovers out of time <br>
                Memories unwind <br>
                So far I still know who you are <br>
                But now I wonder who I was <br>
                Angel, you know it's not the end <br>
                We'll always be good friends <br>
                The letters have been sent on <br>
